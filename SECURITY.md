# Security Policy

DaloyJS is a backend framework, so security issues are treated as release-blocking
work. Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately before opening public
issues or pull requests.

## Supported Versions

DaloyJS is currently pre-1.0. Security fixes target the latest published `0.x`
release and `main`.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `0.1.x` | Yes |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository when available:

<https://github.com/daloyjs/daloy/security/advisories/new>

If that link is unavailable, open a minimal public issue asking for a private
security contact without sharing exploit details.

Please include:

- Affected version or commit.
- Runtime and adapter involved, if any.
- Reproduction steps or a small proof of concept.
- Expected impact and any known mitigations.

## Response Target

- Initial acknowledgement: within 3 business days.
- Triage decision: within 7 business days.
- Fix release: as soon as practical, prioritized ahead of normal roadmap work.

## Scope

Security reports are especially useful for:

- Request parsing, body limits, and content-type bypasses.
- Prototype pollution or unsafe JSON handling.
- Header injection and response splitting.
- Path traversal or router confusion.
- Authentication, timing, CORS, rate limit, and secure header middleware issues.
- Adapter-specific behavior that changes security guarantees across runtimes.

Please do not use destructive tests against systems you do not own.

## Supply-chain security (how DaloyJS is built and published)

We treat the package supply chain as an attack surface. The controls below are
specifically designed against the patterns documented in
[`otherdocs/security-incidence.md`](otherdocs/security-incidence.md), most
recently the TanStack 2026-05-11 worm
([postmortem](https://tanstack.com/blog/npm-supply-chain-compromise-postmortem),
[follow-up](https://tanstack.com/blog/incident-followup)) and the
chalk/debug/node-ipc phishing campaigns.

### CI/CD

- **No `pull_request_target` anywhere in the repo.** Fork PRs run with the
  default `pull_request` trigger and have no access to repo secrets, the GitHub
  Actions cache scope shared with `main`, or any token capable of publishing.
- **Top-level `permissions: {}`** in every workflow; jobs opt in to the
  minimum scopes they need.
- **`actions/checkout` runs with `persist-credentials: false`** so the workflow
  token is not left on disk for later steps to scrape.
- **Third-party GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned.** Workflows execute immutable
  commits instead of mutable version tags, which removes the retagging class of
  supply-chain attack from CI.
- **`step-security/harden-runner`** monitors and (on the publish job) blocks
  egress to anything other than the npm registry, GitHub, and the Sigstore
  endpoints needed for provenance.
- **No GitHub Actions cache** in the standard CI workflow. Cache scope is
  shared between fork PRs and pushes to `main`, which is the cache-poisoning
  vector that bridged TanStack's PR pipeline into its release pipeline.
- **`zizmor`** statically analyses every workflow on every PR
  (`.github/workflows/zizmor.yml`).
- **CodeQL** runs JavaScript/TypeScript and `actions` queries
  (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`).
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** publishes a continuous scorecard
  (`.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`).
- **Dependabot** keeps actions and npm dependencies up to date weekly
  (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
- **`CODEOWNERS`** requires a maintainer to approve any change under
  `.github/`, `package.json`, the lockfile, or `.npmrc`.

### npm publishing

- **Releases are isolated.** The publish workflow
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is triggered only by a signed tag push or
  manual maintainer dispatch. It never runs from a PR, never runs from a
  branch, and never shares a runner with code that came from a fork.
- **`id-token: write` is granted only to the publish job**, only after a
  protected GitHub Environment (`npm-publish`) requires explicit maintainer
  approval. There is no long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` in repo secrets.
- **Publishes use `--provenance`.** Every tarball is bound to its source
  commit and workflow run via npm trusted publishing (OIDC) and Sigstore.
- **Tag/version match is verified** before `pnpm publish` runs.
- **No third-party install scripts run during publish.** Install uses
  `--ignore-scripts`; the few packages that legitimately need to build are
  allowlisted via `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` in `package.json`.

### Maintainer accounts

- **Hardware-backed 2FA only on npm and GitHub.** SMS factors are not
  permitted. Maintainers should rotate credentials immediately after any
  ecosystem-wide phishing campaign (e.g. `npmjs.help`-style lookalikes).
- **Granular npm access tokens only**, scoped to a single package, with IP
  allowlists where the maintainer's network supports it.
- **No publishing from a developer machine.** All published artifacts come
  from `release.yml`.
- **Signed commits and signed tags** for every release.

### Indicators of compromise — what to watch for

If you suspect a compromised version of `@daloyjs/core` or `create-daloy`:

- Compare the published tarball's provenance attestation against the source
  commit at <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daloyjs/core>.
- Look in the published manifest for unexpected `optionalDependencies`,
  `peerDependencies`, or `bin` entries — especially anything pointing to a
  fork (e.g. `github:owner/repo#<sha>`).
- Look in the unpacked tarball for files outside of `dist/` and `README.md`
  (the only paths in our `files` field).
- Report to <https://github.com/daloyjs/daloy/security/advisories/new>.
