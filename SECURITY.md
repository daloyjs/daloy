# Security Policy

DaloyJS is a backend framework, so security issues are treated as release-blocking
work. Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately before opening public
issues or pull requests.

## Supported Versions

DaloyJS is currently pre-1.0. Security fixes target the latest published `0.x`
release and `main`.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `0.1.x` | Yes |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository when available:

<https://github.com/daloyjs/daloy/security/advisories/new>

If that link is unavailable, open a minimal public issue asking for a private
security contact without sharing exploit details.

Please include:

- Affected version or commit.
- Runtime and adapter involved, if any.
- Reproduction steps or a small proof of concept.
- Expected impact and any known mitigations.

## Response Target

- Initial acknowledgement: within 3 business days.
- Triage decision: within 7 business days.
- Fix release: as soon as practical, prioritized ahead of normal roadmap work.

## Scope

Security reports are especially useful for:

- Request parsing, body limits, and content-type bypasses.
- Prototype pollution or unsafe JSON handling.
- Header injection and response splitting.
- Path traversal or router confusion.
- Authentication, timing, CORS, rate limit, and secure header middleware issues.
- Adapter-specific behavior that changes security guarantees across runtimes.

Please do not use destructive tests against systems you do not own.
